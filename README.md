## Following are the steps to setup a development environment on Ubuntu from scratch.


* ### Download and Install [VSCode]

* ### Extensions for vscode that I would prefer are as following:
   1. [Markdown All in One by Yu Zhang]

* ### Terminal Setup
   1. Download and Install [Nerd Fonts].

   2. Download and Install [Guake]:   `sudo apt install guake -y`
    
   3. Set **Nerd Font** as for Text-editor and Terminals

   4. Install **zsh** shell and [oh-my-zsh]

   5. Make zsh as a default shell for terminal

   6. Install [antigen]. (manager for oh-my-zsh extensions and themes.)

   7. Once oh-my-zsh is installed there'll be a .zshrc file, replace that with your own version.

   8. My zshrc: [.zshrc] Reference: [Jon's .zshrc]

* Happy codeing!!

* For any problems please use internet.
